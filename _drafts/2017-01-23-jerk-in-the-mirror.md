title: flavors of sadness & the jerk in the mirror

{{ page.title }}
================

There's a moment in _Twelve Kingdoms_ where three women chat on ramparts,
savoring the quiet before tomorrow's siege. They're not close, they've all
had very different journeys and challenges. Reflecting on her time as a 
scullery maid, one of them says she knows two kinds of sadness: a genuine
sorrow based in compassion and a hollow one rooted in self-pity.

I come back to this scene when I'm sad, angry, or disappointed in myself.
It's uncomfortable because it demands I examine the reasons for my
unhappiness, and I'm ashamed to admit it's often that jerk in the mirror. 
He's a real \<censored\> sometimes, honestly. At least it's only sometimes...

There's an upside to being the cause of one's misery though, which is that
you can fix it.
