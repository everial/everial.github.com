    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="meta">Educational</p>

    <p>I attended <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu">Swarthmore College</a>,
    majoring in <a href="http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu">computer science</a>
    with a minor in mathematics. While at Swarthmore I worked in the Mary Lyons
    breakfast room, was active in SPC, and did after-school tutoring. I
    sometimes wonder how he managed, but I lived with the amazing
    <a href="http://www.milesskorpen.com">Miles Skorpen</a> all four years.</p>

    <p>I've also finished an MBA at <a href="http://www.tepper.cmu.edu">The
        Tepper School of Business</a> at Carnegie Mellon University with
    concentrations in marketing and organizational behavior.</p>

    <p>If you're considering attending either institution please reach out as
    I'm happy to share thoughts on both (favorite classes and professors, good
    eats in the area, cultural trends at each school, et alia).</p>

    <p class="meta">Professional</p> 

    <p>After graduating from Swarthmore I spent a year at PTC working with the
    awesome MathCad team on the WPF user interface rewrite while joking that we 
    were breaking 
    <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">the 
        rules</a>. =)</p>

    <p>I jumped at a chance to at Constitution Medical, now part of Roche 
    Diagnostics, a startup developing a new automatic CBC machine. At CMI I 
    focused on red blood cell morphology, though had
    the wonderful opportunity to work on a variety of projects and tools.</p>

    <p>During business school I interned at Google in gTech's
    Publishers and Solutions group.</p>

    <p class="meta">Technical</p>

    <p>I've worked with a variety of languages in different paradigms including
    C and C++, C#, F#, Python, Java, bash, and SQL. I've also dabbled with php, 
    OCaml, Haskell, SPSS, SAS, and R, though I can't claim fluency with any in 
    this group.<p>

    <p>I have a solid grasp of linear algebra and statistics, especially those
    used in classification tasks and machine learning.</p>
    
    <p>For those that care, I prefer vim to emacs. This disqualifies me
    from being a <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">real programmer</a>.</p>

    <p>I was lead developer on the l1j-en project, an open-source server
    emulator for Lineage, for most of 2011-2013. My commits dropped after 
    starting business school, but others have picked it up!</p>

    <p class="meta">Personal</p>

    <p>When not working I enjoy reading, running, ceramics, board games, 
    tinkering on my piano, cooking, and aikido.</p>
